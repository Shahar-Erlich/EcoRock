             Hello and welcome to EcoRock!
                In this game your goal is
                to hit notes to the music.

                         But be careful, 
            if you miss even a single note
                      the game ends!
At the bottom of the screen there's 4 buttons.
        each corresponds to a "lane" of notes.

                         To hit a note,
           when the note is just overlaping it
                press the correct button!

            Try to get the timing correctly,
           hitting the button too late may:
	            grant less points 
                  or even make you lose!

           There are 2 types of notes:
Short Notes - press the right button
            when the two overlap.

Long Notes -short notes but you have to hold the note 
               until the "trail" ends.

         Each short note will grant you points 
           and long notes grant even more!	
                      
                         Have Fun!
